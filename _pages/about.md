Hi! I'm Hind Dadoun, a researcher interested in applied AI.

During my PhD at Inria's EPIONE team, I focused on developing AI methods for real-time analysis of abdominal ultrasound images. I built everything from scratchâ€”working directly with hospitals to collect and de-identify medical data, designing self-supervised multi-modal models to extract meaningful information from both text and images to generate high-quality AI-based annotations and coordinating labeling efforts to properly evaluate the methods. The project really resonated with me because ultrasound is one of the most affordable imaging techniques, and I saw its potential to democratize access to healthcare worldwide.

After completing my PhD, I joined echOpen, a startup dedicated to creating an affordable portable ultrasound device. As part of a small team, I contributed to various aspects of the project, from developing machine learning workflows to integrating AI features into mobile applications. You can learn more about my work at echOpen in this [video interview](https://www.echopen.com/ressources/videos/decouvrez-echopen-avec-hind-dadoun-phd-specialiste-en-intelligence-artificelle).

Now based in the Bay Area, I'm exploring the latest advancements in large language models and their applications in healthcare and beyond.
