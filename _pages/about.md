Hi, I’m Hind Dadoun—a researcher focused on applied AI. Based in the Bay Area, I’m currently exploring cutting-edge developments in large language models, with a particular interest in their applications in healthcare and other real-world domains.

During my PhD at Inria's EPIONE team, I focused on developing AI methods for real-time analysis of abdominal ultrasound images. I built everything from scratch—working directly with hospitals to collect and de-identify medical data, designing self-supervised multi-modal models to extract meaningful information from both text and images to generate high-quality AI-based annotations and coordinating labeling efforts to properly evaluate the methods. 

After completing my PhD, I joined echOpen, a startup dedicated to creating an affordable portable ultrasound device. As part of a small team, I contributed to various aspects of the project, from developing machine learning workflows to integrating AI features into mobile applications. You can learn more about my work at echOpen in this [video interview](https://www.echopen.com/ressources/videos/decouvrez-echopen-avec-hind-dadoun-phd-specialiste-en-intelligence-artificelle).
