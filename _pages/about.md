Hi, I'm Hind Dadoun. I'm an AI researcher based in the Bay Area, working on practical applications of machine learning with a special interest in healthcare.

During my PhD at Inria, I worked with hospitals to develop AI tools for ultrasound image analysis. My research involved collecting medical data, building models that could learn from both images and text, and testing these approaches in real clinical settings.

After finishing my doctorate, I joined echOpen, a small startup creating affordable portable ultrasound devices. I wore many hats thereâ€”developing machine learning systems, helping integrate AI features into our mobile apps, and collaborating with our clinical partners. If you're curious about that work, there's a brief interview video where I talk about it.

These days, I'm exploring how large language models can be applied to solve real problems, especially in healthcare.
